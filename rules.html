                        <p>The main point of this course is to have fun making art.  And to make art that is fun!</p>  
                        <p>But...what makes something fun?  And what makes something art?</p>
                        <p>This course we will explore some of the many ways which artists have used games, and fun, to extend and challenge themselves and their audiences.</p>
                        <p>Along the way we will consider Dada and Surrealist and Fluxus and Minimalist and Situationist and Relational and Political and Nonsense and Language and all sorts of other games in all sorts of mediums.</p>
                        <p>You may produce your games in any medium.  Instead of games, you may produce blueprints or sketches of games or you may produce movies about or using games, or you may produce poems or music or performance.  You should be willing to serve as a performer or cast member or audience member for your classmates.</p>
                        <p>Our final project will actually be two projects: first, a game, of your design; and second, a gallery show of documentation of a performance or various performances of that game.  Students will be asked to present their final game projects on their scheduled critique days and then will all create a single gallery show together, on the last day of class, consisting of the documentation of those performances.  This documentation can be photgraphic, video, text, sculptural or...other!</p>
                        <p>In addition to your game projects, you will be expected to complete regular assignments using the techniques and technologies which will be introduced in class, which will include 3D modeling, compositing and a variety of tools for computer game design/building.</p>
                        <p>Some basic experience with writing web code will be helpful, but not required.  If you have no experience with code but are interested to learn more please visit the <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page for a host of resources to help you along your way.  There will always be non-coding ways to complete assignments.</p>
